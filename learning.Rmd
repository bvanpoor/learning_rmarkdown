```
#!/bin/bash

echo "Why am I doing BASH in this course?"

Rscript --vanilla run_away.R
```

## Math
This is a covariance equation, random variable $X$ co-variace with random variable $Y$, where $\\bar{X} = mean(X)$ and $\\bar{Y} = mean(Y)$ and $N$ is a size of a random sample from the population.

$$
cov(X,Y) = \frac{\sum(X_{i}-\bar{X})(Y_{i}-\bar{Y})}{N-1}
$$
