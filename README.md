This file is my introduction to creating a webpage from Rmarkdown. The idea is for me to get familiary with the language and layout for when we create a lab webpage later this week. 

For this, I am following the steps found in https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/index.html. 

##another test to make sure this works
